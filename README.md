My second Techdegree project - List Pagination and Filtering

This project contains only "vanilla" JavaScript and the principle of progressive enhancement and unobtrusive JavaScript to improve the basic functionality of the page.

The project has three main functions:

- showPage() - creates the logic to show only maximum 10 elements on the page
- appendPageLinks() - dynamically add pagination links based on showPage
- handleSearch() - dynamically handles click and keyup events with basic filtering
